# Fun Facts Splashscreens for RetroPie

> Not working yet! Well, it's working, but it's not officially released! It's just for testing purposes!

This script creates a splashscreen for RetroPie with a random 'Fun Fact!' to be shown at boot.

An option can be enabled to automatically create a new splashscreen at every boot.

For now, the best way to use the splashscreen created by this script is to use the `Choose Own Splashscreen` option under the **Splashscreen Menu** in **RetroPie settings**. See the [Splashscreen wiki](https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/splashscreen).

## Instalation

```
cd /home/pi/
git clone https://github.com/hiulit/es-fun-facts-splashscreens.git
cd es-fun-facts-splashscreens/
sudo chmod +x es-fun-facts-splashscreens.sh
```

## Usage

```
sudo ./es-fun-facts-splashscreens.sh [options]
```

If no option is passed, you will be prompted with a usage example:

```
USAGE: sudo ./es-fun-facts-splashscreens.sh [options]

Use '--help' to see all the options
```
